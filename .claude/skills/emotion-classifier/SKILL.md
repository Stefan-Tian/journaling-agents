# Emotion Classifier Skill

**Purpose**: Identify, classify, and provide insights into emotions expressed in journal entries using research-backed frameworks.

**Trigger**: `/emotions` or `/emotion-classifier`

## Overview

**Important**: This skill references [../context.md](../context.md) for Stefan's personal context. See [reference.md](reference.md) for details.

This skill uses evidence-based emotion science, including Yale's Mood Meter framework and research from leading emotion psychologists (Marc Brackett, Lisa Feldman Barrett, Brené Brown), to:

1. **Identify emotions** present in Stefan's journal entry
2. **Classify them** by pleasantness and energy levels
3. **Provide psychological insights** into why these emotions emerged
4. **Explain emotional impact** on thoughts, behaviors, and well-being
5. **Offer navigation strategies** for processing and managing these emotions

## When to Use
