## Yale's Mood Meter Framework

Developed by Dr. Marc Brackett and the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, the Mood Meter is a research-based tool that maps emotions along two dimensions:

### The Two Dimensions

1. **Pleasantness** (Horizontal axis): How pleasant or unpleasant the feeling is
2. **Energy** (Vertical axis): How much energy the emotion brings (high activation vs. low activation)

### The Four Quadrants

#### Red Quadrant (High Energy, Unpleasant)
**Characteristics**: Intense, activated, uncomfortable feelings
**Emotions include**:
- Angry, furious, enraged, outraged, livid
- Anxious, worried, nervous, panicked, stressed
- Scared, fearful, terrified, alarmed
- Frustrated, annoyed, irritated, aggravated
- Embarrassed, humiliated, ashamed
- Jealous, envious

**Physiological signs**: Increased heart rate, muscle tension, rapid breathing, heat, restlessness

#### Yellow Quadrant (High Energy, Pleasant)
**Characteristics**: Energized, activated, positive feelings
**Emotions include**:
- Happy, joyful, elated, ecstatic, delighted
- Excited, thrilled, enthusiastic, exhilarated
- Energized, motivated, inspired, invigorated
- Optimistic, hopeful, confident, empowered
- Proud, accomplished, successful
- Playful, silly, amused, entertained
- Surprised (pleasant), amazed, awestruck

**Physiological signs**: Lightness, openness, energy, expansiveness, warmth

#### Green Quadrant (Low Energy, Pleasant)
**Characteristics**: Calm, relaxed, positive feelings
**Emotions include**:
- Calm, peaceful, tranquil, serene, still
- Content, satisfied, fulfilled, at ease
- Comfortable, cozy, safe, secure
- Grateful, thankful, appreciative
- Loving, tender, affectionate, caring
- Balanced, centered, grounded
- Reflective, contemplative, thoughtful

**Physiological signs**: Slow breathing, relaxed muscles, steady heart rate, softness

#### Blue Quadrant (Low Energy, Unpleasant)
**Characteristics**: Low energy, uncomfortable, withdrawn feelings
**Emotions include**:
- Sad, sorrowful, heartbroken, grieving, melancholy

**Physiological signs**: Low energy, heaviness, fatigue, slowed movement, withdrawal

## Lisa Feldman Barrett's Theory of Constructed Emotion

### Key Principles

1. **Emotions are constructed**: The brain predicts and constructs emotional experiences based on past experiences, context, and bodily sensations.

2. **Emotion granularity**: The ability to distinguish between emotions with precision (emotional granularity) is linked to better mental health and emotion regulation.

3. **Affect as core**: Underlying all emotions are two dimensions:
   - **Valence**: Pleasant to unpleasant
   - **Arousal**: Activated to deactivated

4. **Concepts shape experience**: Having words and concepts for emotions helps us experience and regulate them more effectively.

### Implications for Journaling

- Naming emotions precisely helps construct more adaptive emotional experiences
- Understanding context helps reframe emotional interpretations
- Bodily awareness (interoception) is key to emotional awareness

## Brené Brown's Emotion Research

### Core Insights

1. **Vulnerability and emotion**: Difficult emotions often contain important information about our values and boundaries.

2. **Shame vs. Guilt**:
   - **Shame**: "I am bad" (about self)
   - **Guilt**: "I did something bad" (about behavior)
   - Guilt is adaptive; shame is often destructive

3. **The importance of empathy**: Connecting with emotions requires empathy for ourselves and others.

4. **Emotion vs. Story**: Distinguishing between the emotion itself and the story we tell about it.

### Common Emotion Pairs to Distinguish

- **Anxiety vs. Excitement**: Both high-energy, but different valence
- **Guilt vs. Shame**: Behavior-focused vs. identity-focused
- **Loneliness vs. Solitude**: Unwanted vs. chosen aloneness
- **Envy vs. Jealousy**: Wanting what others have vs. fear of losing what you have

## The Wheel of Emotions (Robert Plutchik)

### Eight Primary Emotions

1. **Joy** ↔ **Sadness**
2. **Trust** ↔ **Disgust**
3. **Fear** ↔ **Anger**
4. **Surprise** ↔ **Anticipation**

### Secondary Emotions (Combinations)

- Joy + Trust = Love
- Trust + Fear = Submission
- Fear + Surprise = Awe
- Surprise + Sadness = Disapproval
- Sadness + Disgust = Remorse
- Disgust + Anger = Contempt
- Anger + Anticipation = Aggressiveness
- Anticipation + Joy = Optimism

## Emotional Needs Framework

### Universal Emotional Needs

Based on Self-Determination Theory and humanistic psychology:

1. **Autonomy**: Need for choice, control, and self-direction
2. **Competence**: Need to feel capable and effective
3. **Connection**: Need for belonging and meaningful relationships
4. **Safety**: Physical and psychological security
5. **Significance**: Need to matter and have purpose
6. **Growth**: Need for learning and development

**When these needs are met**: Pleasant emotions (joy, contentment, pride)
**When these needs are unmet**: Unpleasant emotions (frustration, sadness, anxiety)

## Emotion Regulation Strategies

### Evidence-Based Techniques

1. **Situation Selection**: Choose environments that promote desired emotions
2. **Situation Modification**: Change the situation to alter emotional impact
3. **Attentional Deployment**: Redirect focus (distraction or concentration)
4. **Cognitive Change**: Reappraisal, reframing, perspective-taking
5. **Response Modulation**: Direct influence on emotional response (breathing, exercise)

### The RULER Approach (Yale)

- **R**ecognizing emotions in self and others
- **U**nderstanding causes and consequences
- **L**abeling emotions with precise vocabulary
- **E**xpressing emotions appropriately
- **R**egulating emotions effectively

## Window of Tolerance (Dan Siegel)

### Three Zones

1. **Hyperarousal** (Red zone): Fight-or-flight, anxiety, anger
2. **Window of Tolerance** (Green/Yellow): Optimal functioning
3. **Hypoarousal** (Blue zone): Shutdown, dissociation, numbness

**Goal**: Expand the window of tolerance through awareness and regulation.

## Polyvagal Theory (Stephen Porges)

### Three Neural States

1. **Ventral Vagal** (Social engagement): Safe, connected, regulated
2. **Sympathetic** (Mobilization): Fight-or-flight, anxiety, anger
3. **Dorsal Vagal** (Immobilization): Shutdown, freeze, dissociation

**Implication**: Safety signals help regulate emotional states.
