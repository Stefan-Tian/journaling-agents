description: Analyze relationship dynamics using frameworks from Esther Perel, Helen Fisher, John Gottman, Sue Johnson, and Stan Tatkin
---

## Overview

**Important**: This skill references [../context.md](../context.md) for Stefan's personal context.

This skill provides relationship-focused analysis drawing from leading relationship experts and attachment researchers. It helps you:

1. **Understand relationship dynamics** - patterns in how you connect, conflict, and repair
2. **Explore attachment patterns** - your attachment style and how it shows up
3. **Navigate desire and intimacy** - the tension between security and aliveness
4. **Build secure functioning** - co-regulation and mutual protection
5. **Identify communication patterns** - bids, repairs, and the Four Horsemen

## Theoretical Frameworks

### Esther Perel - Erotic Intelligence

**Core Tension**: Security vs. Adventure
- Relationships need both safety AND aliveness
- Too much security kills desire; too much unpredictability kills trust
- The erotic thrives in the space between the familiar and the unknown

**Key Concepts**:
- **Erotic Intelligence**: The ability to maintain desire within committed relationships
- **Mating in Captivity**: How domesticity can dampen passion
- **The Third**: Maintaining separateness and mystery within togetherness
- **Relational Ambiguity**: Comfort with uncertainty in relationships

**Questions Perel Asks**:
- "Where do you go when you're not with me?"
- "What parts of yourself have you put aside for this relationship?"
- "Can you desire what you already have?"

### Helen Fisher - The Biology of Love

**Four Romantic Temperaments** (based on neurochemistry):
| Type | Dominant System | Traits | Attracted To |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| **Explorer** | Dopamine | Adventurous, creative, spontaneous, novelty-seeking | Other Explorers |
| **Builder** | Serotonin | Cautious, conventional, loyal, detail-oriented | Other Builders |
| **Director** | Testosterone | Analytical, decisive, competitive, direct | Negotiators |
| **Negotiator** | Estrogen/Oxytocin | Empathetic, intuitive, verbal, idealistic | Directors |

**Three Brain Systems of Love**:
1. **Lust** (sex drive) - testosterone/estrogen
2. **Romantic Attraction** (obsessive focus) - dopamine
3. **Attachment** (long-term bonding) - oxytocin/vasopressin

**Why We Love**: Fisher's research shows love is a drive, not just an emotion - as fundamental as hunger or thirst.

### John Gottman - The Science of Relationships

**The Four Horsemen** (predictors of relationship failure):
1. **Criticism** - Attacking character rather than behavior ("You always..." "You never...")
2. **Contempt** - Superiority, mockery, eye-rolling (THE most destructive)
3. **Defensiveness** - Denying responsibility, counter-attacking
4. **Stonewalling** - Withdrawing, shutting down, refusing to engage

**Antidotes to the Four Horsemen**:
- Criticism → Gentle Start-up (use "I" statements, describe your needs)
- Contempt → Build Culture of Appreciation (express gratitude, respect)
- Defensiveness → Take Responsibility (accept even part of the complaint)
- Stonewalling → Self-Soothe (take a break, then return to discuss)

**Bids for Connection**:
- Small moments of reaching out for attention, affection, support
- Partners can **turn toward**, **turn away**, or **turn against** bids
- Successful couples turn toward bids 86% of the time; struggling couples only 33%

**The Magic Ratio**: 5:1 - Five positive interactions for every negative one predicts relationship stability

**Repair Attempts**: Any action to de-escalate tension during conflict. Successful relationships aren't conflict-free - they repair well.

### Sue Johnson - Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)

**Core Question**: "Are you there for me?"

**Attachment Needs in Adult Relationships**:
- **Accessibility**: Can I reach you?
- **Responsiveness**: Will you respond to my needs?
- **Engagement**: Will you value me and stay close?

**The Negative Cycle**:
Most couples get stuck in a **pursue-withdraw** or **attack-defend** cycle:
- One partner pursues (criticizes, demands, escalates) to get response
- Other partner withdraws (shuts down, avoids, defends) to manage overwhelm
- Both are trying to protect themselves and the relationship

**Attachment Injuries**:
Moments when a partner fails to respond at a critical time of need. These become stuck points that resurface until processed.

**Hold Me Tight Conversations**:
1. Recognizing the Demon Dialogues (negative cycles)
2. Finding the Raw Spots (attachment fears)
3. Revisiting Rocky Moments (de-escalating fights)
4. Hold Me Tight (expressing attachment needs)
5. Forgiving Injuries (healing past hurts)
6. Bonding Through Sex (safe emotional connection)
7. Keeping Your Love Alive (ongoing rituals)

### Stan Tatkin - Psychobiological Approach (PACT)

**Secure Functioning**:
The commitment to be a team - to protect each other's safety, security, and nervous system. "We come first."

**Core Principles**:
- **Mutual Protection**: Partners protect each other from themselves and the world
- **Co-Regulation**: Using each other to regulate arousal and distress
- **The Couple Bubble**: Creating a safe container that holds both partners

**Arousal Regulation**:
- **Anchors** (secure): Regulate themselves AND others well
- **Islands** (avoidant): Self-regulate but struggle to co-regulate
- **Waves** (anxious): Need external regulation, overwhelm easily

**Waking Up the Partner**:
Tatkin emphasizes reading your partner's face, voice, and body - tracking their nervous system in real-time.

**Fairness vs. Sensitivity**:
Move from "What's fair?" to "What does my partner need to feel safe?" Secure functioning prioritizes the relationship over individual scorekeeping.

2. **Patterns Over People**: Focus on dynamics, not blame
3. **Both/And**: Security AND adventure, independence AND connection
4. **The Body Knows**: Nervous system responses carry wisdom
5. **Repair is Everything**: Ruptures are inevitable; repair is the skill
6. **Context Matters**: Stefan's specific context (gay dating, Taiwan, seeking relationship) informs analysis

## Tone & Approach

- Normalize attachment needs and relationship struggles
- Curious about patterns rather than judgmental
- Balance validation with growth-oriented insights
- Honor the complexity of desire and intimacy
- Recognize cultural and LGBTQ+ specific dynamics

## Important Note

This skill is for self-reflection on relationships, not couples therapy. For significant relationship distress, consider working with a licensed couples therapist trained in EFT or Gottman Method.
