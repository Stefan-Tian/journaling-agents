## Esther Perel - Detailed Framework

### The Erotic vs. Domestic

Perel argues that the qualities that nurture love (safety, security, predictability) are often at odds with the qualities that nurture desire (novelty, mystery, risk).

**Domestic Love Needs**:
- Safety, security, reliability
- Knowing your partner deeply
- Comfort and familiarity
- Interdependence and merging

**Erotic Desire Needs**:
- Mystery, surprise, novelty
- Seeing your partner as "other"
- Risk and transgression
- Separateness and autonomy

### Maintaining Desire in Committed Relationships

**Key Strategies**:
1. **Cultivate Separateness**: Maintain individual interests, friendships, inner life
2. **Create Novelty**: New experiences together, break routines
3. **Embrace Mystery**: You can never fully know another person
4. **Play and Imagination**: Fantasy, role-play, playfulness
5. **See Your Partner with Fresh Eyes**: Observe them in contexts where they shine

### Questions for Exploration

- When do you feel most drawn to your partner?
- What do you need to feel desiring vs. desired?
- What parts of yourself do you hide in relationships?
- How do you balance closeness and autonomy?
- What risks have you stopped taking in love?

### On Infidelity and Betrayal

Perel's work on affairs examines:
- Affairs as symptoms of unmet needs (not excuses)
- The difference between the "marriage that was" and "the marriage that could be"
- Rebuilding after betrayal requires grieving the old relationship

## Helen Fisher - Detailed Framework

### The Four Temperaments Deep Dive

**The Explorer (Dopamine)**
- Seeks novelty, adventure, spontaneity
- Creative, curious, risk-taking
- May struggle with commitment, routine
- Best matched with other Explorers
- Needs: Freedom, excitement, variety

**The Builder (Serotonin)**
- Values tradition, loyalty, stability
- Detail-oriented, cautious, respectful
- May struggle with flexibility, spontaneity
- Best matched with other Builders
- Needs: Predictability, shared values, social connection

**The Director (Testosterone)**
- Analytical, competitive, decisive
- Direct communication, strategic thinking
- May struggle with emotional attunement
- Best matched with Negotiators (complementary)
- Needs: Respect, competence recognition, autonomy

**The Negotiator (Estrogen/Oxytocin)**
- Empathetic, verbal, intuitive
- Sees big picture, diplomatic
- May struggle with decisiveness, directness
- Best matched with Directors (complementary)
- Needs: Emotional connection, meaning, harmony

### The Three Brain Systems

**Lust (Sex Drive)**
- Evolved for mating
- Driven by testosterone/estrogen
- Can be directed at many people
- Relatively indiscriminate

**Romantic Love (Attraction)**
- Evolved for mate selection
- Driven by dopamine (reward), norepinephrine (alertness), serotonin (obsession)
- Focused on one person
- Obsessive, energizing, addictive qualities

**Attachment (Bonding)**
- Evolved for pair-bonding and parenting
- Driven by oxytocin and vasopressin
- Calm, comfortable connection
- Takes time to develop

### Why Understanding This Matters

- These systems can operate independently (love without lust, lust without love)
- Long-term relationships often see lust and romantic love fade while attachment grows
- Conscious effort needed to maintain all three systems
- New partners can activate romantic love system even when attached elsewhere (explaining affairs)

## John Gottman - Detailed Framework

### The Four Horsemen In-Depth

**Criticism**
- Attacking partner's character or personality
- Generalizing: "You always..." "You never..."
- Blaming: "What's wrong with you?"
- Different from complaint (specific behavior + feeling)

*Antidote - Gentle Start-up*:
- Start with "I" not "You"
- Describe what you see/hear (not interpret)
- Express your feeling
- State your positive need
- Example: "I felt worried when you came home late. I need a quick text if plans change."

**Contempt**
- Treating partner as inferior
- Mockery, sarcasm, eye-rolling, name-calling
- Communicates disgust
- The strongest predictor of divorce
- Often stems from long-simmering negative thoughts

*Antidote - Build Culture of Appreciation*:
- Daily expressions of gratitude
- Catch partner doing things right
- Express admiration and respect
- Build a "positive sentiment override"

**Defensiveness**
- Self-protection through excuses
- Counter-attacking ("Well, what about when YOU...")
- Playing victim
- Denying responsibility
- Escalates conflict rather than resolving it

*Antidote - Take Responsibility*:
- Accept even partial responsibility
- "You're right, I did forget. I should have..."
- Apologize for your part
- Validate partner's perspective before explaining yours

**Stonewalling**
- Withdrawing from interaction
- Shutting down, tuning out
- Often happens when flooded (overwhelmed)
- Typically more common in men
- Feels like abandonment to pursuing partner

*Antidote - Self-Soothe*:
- Take a break (at least 20 minutes to physiologically calm)
- Signal you'll return: "I need 30 minutes, then let's talk"
- Do something soothing (walk, breathe, distract)
- Return and re-engage

### Bids for Connection

**What is a bid?**
Any attempt to connect - verbal or nonverbal:
- "Look at this sunset"
- A sigh
- Reaching for hand
- Sharing a thought
- Asking for help
- Initiating sex

**Three Responses**:
1. **Turn Toward**: Acknowledge and engage (builds emotional bank account)
2. **Turn Away**: Ignore or miss the bid (creates distance)
3. **Turn Against**: Respond with hostility (erodes trust)

**Why This Matters**:
The pattern of bid-response creates relationship culture. Masters of relationships are constantly turning toward small bids.

### The Sound Relationship House

Gottman's model of healthy relationships:

1. **Build Love Maps** (know partner's inner world)
2. **Share Fondness and Admiration** (express appreciation)
3. **Turn Toward** (respond to bids)
4. **Positive Perspective** (give benefit of doubt)
5. **Manage Conflict** (dialogue about problems)
6. **Make Life Dreams Come True** (support each other's goals)
7. **Create Shared Meaning** (rituals, roles, goals, symbols)

*Walls that support the house*: Trust and Commitment

## Sue Johnson - EFT Detailed Framework

### Attachment Theory in Adult Relationships

**The Core Need**: We are wired for connection. Seeking closeness is not weakness - it's survival.

**Attachment Styles** (based on Bowlby/Ainsworth):

| Style | Core Belief | Behavior | Need |
|-------|-------------|----------|------|
| **Secure** | "I am worthy of love; others are trustworthy" | Comfortable with intimacy and independence | Balanced connection |
| **Anxious/Preoccupied** | "I need others to feel okay; they might leave" | Pursues, protests, hypervigilant to rejection | Reassurance and consistency |
| **Avoidant/Dismissive** | "I'm fine alone; depending on others is risky" | Withdraws, self-sufficient, uncomfortable with closeness | Space and autonomy |
| **Disorganized/Fearful** | "I want closeness but it's dangerous" | Push-pull, chaotic, trauma-based | Safety and predictability |

### The Negative Cycle

Most relationship distress follows a **predictable pattern**:

**Pursue-Withdraw Cycle**:
- Partner A feels disconnected → reaches out (criticizes, demands, escalates)
- Partner B feels attacked → withdraws (shuts down, avoids, minimizes)
- Partner A feels more abandoned → pursues harder
- Partner B feels more overwhelmed → withdraws more
- Cycle escalates

**The Key Insight**: Both partners are trying to cope with attachment distress. The pursuer is protesting disconnection. The withdrawer is managing overwhelm. Neither is the problem - the CYCLE is the problem.

### Attachment Injuries

Critical moments when a partner failed to respond:
- During illness, loss, or vulnerability
- At moments of transition (pregnancy, job loss)
- Betrayals of trust

These become "stuck" until the injured partner can:
1. Share the pain
2. Have it acknowledged and understood
3. See partner's genuine remorse
4. Receive comfort

### EFT Change Events

**Withdrawer Re-engagement**:
The withdrawn partner accesses and shares underlying attachment fears and needs, becoming more accessible.

**Blamer Softening**:
The pursuing partner moves from angry protest to vulnerable sharing of attachment needs, asking for comfort from a safe place.

- Process the pain together
- Rebuild trust through responsiveness

- Connect sex to emotional safety
- Share desires and fears
- Create erotic connection from secure base

**Conversation 7: Keeping Love Alive**
- Create rituals of connection
- Anticipate and prevent negative cycles
- Maintain the secure bond

## Stan Tatkin - PACT Detailed Framework

### Secure Functioning Principles

**The Couple Bubble**:
A mutual agreement to protect the relationship above all else. "We come first" - before work, family of origin, friends, individual desires.

**Core Agreements**:
1. I will protect you from myself (manage my reactions)
2. I will protect you from others
3. I will put our relationship first
4. I will ensure you feel safe and secure

### Arousal Regulation Types

**Anchors (Secure)**:
- Self-regulate well
- Co-regulate well
- Comfortable with closeness and autonomy
- Move fluidly between connection and independence

**Islands (Avoidant)**:
- Self-regulate well (prefer alone time to calm)
- Struggle to co-regulate (don't naturally reach for partner)
- Value independence highly
- May seem distant or unavailable
- Need: Respect for space, low-pressure invitations to connect

**Waves (Anxious)**:
- Struggle to self-regulate (need external regulation)
- Seek co-regulation actively
- Value connection highly
- May seem clingy or demanding
- Need: Consistent reassurance, reliability, physical comfort

**Island-Wave Pairs** (common):
- Wave feels abandoned when Island pulls away
- Island feels overwhelmed when Wave pursues
- Both need to learn the other's regulatory needs

### Reading Your Partner

Tatkin emphasizes becoming an expert on your partner's:
- **Face**: Reading micro-expressions, eyes, emotional state
- **Voice**: Tone, pace, volume changes
- **Body**: Posture, tension, approach/avoidance

**Waking Up the Partner**: Being fully present, eyes engaged, tracking the other person moment-to-moment.

### Couple Meetings

Regular structured time to:
- Check in on the relationship
- Address small issues before they grow
- Plan and coordinate
- Maintain the couple bubble

### Fairness vs. Sensitivity

**Fairness model** (scorekeeping):
- "I did X, so you should do Y"
- Keeps track of who did what
- Creates resentment and competition

**Sensitivity model** (secure functioning):
- "What does my partner need to feel safe?"
- Prioritizes relationship over individual score
- Creates mutual care and protection

### Pro-Relationship Moves

Actions that prioritize the relationship:
- Quick repair after conflict
- Public displays of loyalty
- Never threatening the relationship
- Protecting partner from your family
- Making decisions together
