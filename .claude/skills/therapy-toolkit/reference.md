## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

### The CBT Model

**Core Principle**: Thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. Changing thoughts changes feelings and behaviors.

```
Situation → Thoughts → Feelings → Behaviors
              ↑__________________________|
```

### Common Cognitive Distortions

**Aaron Beck & David Burns' Classic Distortions:**

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black-and-White)**
   - Seeing things in absolutes: always, never, perfect, disaster
   - Example: "If I don't get this job, I'm a complete failure"

2. **Overgeneralization**
   - Single event becomes a pattern
   - Example: "I got rejected once, so I'll always be rejected"

3. **Mental Filter**
   - Focusing exclusively on negatives while filtering out positives
   - Example: Receiving 9 compliments and 1 criticism, only remembering the criticism

4. **Disqualifying the Positive**
   - Dismissing positive experiences as "they don't count"
   - Example: "They're just being nice, they don't mean it"

5. **Jumping to Conclusions**
   - **Mind Reading**: Assuming you know what others think
   - **Fortune Telling**: Predicting negative outcomes
   - Example: "They haven't texted back, they must hate me"

6. **Magnification/Minimization (Catastrophizing)**
   - Exaggerating problems, minimizing positives
   - Example: "This small mistake will ruin everything"

7. **Emotional Reasoning**
   - Believing feelings reflect reality
   - Example: "I feel like a fraud, therefore I am a fraud"

8. **Should Statements**
   - Rigid rules about how you/others "should" be
   - Example: "I should always be productive" or "They should know better"

9. **Labeling**
   - Global labels instead of specific behaviors
   - Example: "I'm lazy" vs. "I didn't feel motivated today"

10. **Personalization/Blame**
    - Taking responsibility for things outside your control OR blaming others entirely
    - Example: "It's all my fault" or "It's all their fault"

### Cognitive Restructuring Process

**The 7-Column Thought Record:**

1. **Situation**: What happened? (objective facts)
2. **Automatic Thought**: What went through your mind?
3. **Emotion**: What did you feel? (intensity 0-100)
4. **Evidence For**: What supports this thought?
5. **Evidence Against**: What contradicts this thought?
6. **Alternative Thought**: More balanced perspective
7. **New Emotion**: How do you feel now? (intensity 0-100)

### Core Beliefs

**Three Levels of Cognition:**

1. **Automatic Thoughts**: Surface-level, spontaneous thoughts
2. **Intermediate Beliefs**: Rules, attitudes, assumptions ("If...then" statements)
3. **Core Beliefs**: Deep beliefs about self, others, world

**Common Core Belief Themes:**
- **Helplessness**: "I'm powerless," "I'm inadequate," "I'm a failure"
- **Unlovability**: "I'm unworthy," "I'm defective," "I'll be abandoned"
- **Worthlessness**: "I'm bad," "I don't matter," "I'm insignificant"

### Socratic Questioning

Therapeutic questions to examine thoughts:

- What's the evidence for and against this thought?
- What would you tell a friend who had this thought?
- What's the worst that could happen? How would you cope?
- What's the best that could happen? What's most realistic?
- What's the effect of believing this thought?
- What would be a more helpful way to think about this?

## Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

### Core Dialectic

**Balance opposites**: Acceptance AND Change

---

## Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

### The Six Core Processes (Hexaflex)

#### 1. Cognitive Defusion

**Principle**: Thoughts are just thoughts, not facts or commands.

**Techniques:**
- "I'm having the thought that..."
- Thank your mind: "Thanks, mind, for that thought"
- Sing the thought to a silly tune
- Say the word repeatedly until it loses meaning
- Imagine thoughts as leaves floating down a stream

#### 2. Acceptance

**Principle**: Make room for painful feelings and sensations rather than struggling against them.

**Practices:**
- Notice resistance and soften
- Breathe into discomfort
- Expand awareness around difficult feelings
- "What if I didn't have to fix this feeling?"

#### 3. Present Moment

**Principle**: Conscious awareness of the here and now.

**Practices:**
- Five senses grounding
- Notice what's here right now
- Return attention to the present when mind wanders
- Engage fully in current activity

#### 4. Self as Context

**Principle**: You are not your thoughts, feelings, or experiences—you're the awareness experiencing them.

**Perspective:**
- Observer self vs. thinking self
- "I notice I'm having anxiety" vs. "I am anxious"
- The sky (you) vs. the weather (your experiences)

#### 5. Values

**Principle**: Chosen life directions that guide meaningful action.

**Values vs. Goals:**
- Values are directions (ongoing): "Being a loving partner"
- Goals are destinations (achievable): "Getting married"

**Core Life Domains:**
- Relationships (family, friends, intimate)
- Work/Education/Growth
- Recreation/Leisure
- Health/Well-being
- Spirituality/Contribution

**Values Clarification Questions:**
- What do you want your life to stand for?
- What do you want to be remembered for?
- If no one would know, what would you do?

#### 6. Committed Action

**Principle**: Take values-based action even in the presence of discomfort.

**Implementation:**
- Break values into specific behaviors
- SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Start small (tiny habits)
- Notice barriers (fusion, avoidance)

### Psychological Flexibility

The meta-goal of ACT: Being present, open, and engaged in what matters.

**Inflexibility → Flexibility:**
- Fusion → Defusion
- Avoidance → Acceptance
- Past/Future focus → Present moment
- Attachment to conceptualized self → Self as context
- Lack of clarity → Values clarity
- Inaction/Impulsivity → Committed action

---

## Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT)

### Three Affect Regulation Systems

1. **Threat System** (Red): Protection, safety-seeking
   - Anxiety, anger, disgust
   - Fight/flight/freeze

2. **Drive System** (Orange): Achievement, resource-seeking
   - Excitement, motivation, pursuit
   - Dopamine-driven

3. **Soothing System** (Green): Contentment, affiliation
   - Calm, safe, connected
   - Oxytocin-based

**Modern Problem**: Overactive threat/drive systems, underactive soothing system.

### Self-Compassion (Kristin Neff)

**Three Components:**

1. **Self-Kindness** vs. Self-Judgment
   - Treating yourself with warmth and understanding
   - Being gentle rather than harsh

2. **Common Humanity** vs. Isolation
   - Recognizing suffering is part of shared human experience
   - "I'm not alone in this"

3. **Mindfulness** vs. Over-Identification
   - Balanced awareness of painful thoughts/feelings
   - Neither suppressing nor ruminating

### Compassionate Mind Practice

**Compassionate Self Attributes:**
- Caring for well-being
- Sensitivity to suffering
- Sympathy and concern
- Distress tolerance
- Empathy and understanding
- Non-judgment

**What Would You Say to a Friend?**
- Notice the difference between how you talk to yourself vs. how you'd talk to someone you care about
- Extend that same kindness to yourself

### Functions of Self-Criticism

**Understanding the Inner Critic:**
- Often trying to protect you (from failure, rejection, shame)
- Learned strategy, usually from childhood
- Harsh doesn't mean effective

**Reframing:**
- From: "I'm so stupid for making that mistake"
- To: "Part of me is scared I'll fail, and it's trying to protect me by being harsh. But there's a kinder way to motivate myself."

## Internal Family Systems (IFS)

### Core Concepts

**Parts**: Sub-personalities or mental/emotional states within you.

**Self**: Core essence characterized by curiosity, compassion, calm, confidence, courage, clarity, creativity, connectedness (the 8 C's).

### Types of Parts

1. **Exiles**: Vulnerable parts carrying pain, shame, trauma
   - Often young parts holding difficult emotions
   - Other parts try to keep them hidden

2. **Managers**: Proactive protectors
   - Try to keep you in control and safe
   - Examples: Perfectionist, Critic, Planner, Caretaker

3. **Firefighters**: Reactive protectors
   - Activated when exiles break through
   - Distraction, numbing, impulsive behaviors
   - Examples: Binge eating, substance use, dissociation

### IFS Process

1. **Notice** a part (voice, feeling, sensation)
2. **Get curious** about it (not pushing it away)
3. **Ask** what it wants you to know
4. **Understand** its positive intent
5. **Appreciate** it for trying to help
6. **Negotiate** with it from Self

**Sample Dialogue:**
- "I notice a part of me that's really anxious about this decision."
- "What are you afraid will happen if I make the wrong choice?"
- "You're trying to protect me from failure. I appreciate that."
- "What if we worked together? What would you need from me to relax a bit?"

## Additional Evidence-Based Techniques

### Behavioral Activation (BA)

**Core Principle**: Depression/avoidance maintained by withdrawing from activities. Reverse by engaging in values-aligned action even when not motivated.

**Steps:**
1. Monitor current activities and mood
2. Identify values-aligned activities
3. Schedule specific activities
4. Start small and build
5. Notice mood shifts (action precedes motivation)

### Problem-Solving Therapy (PST)

**7 Steps:**
1. Identify the problem (specific, concrete)
2. Set realistic goals
3. Brainstorm solutions (no evaluation yet)
4. Evaluate options (pros/cons)
5. Choose best solution
6. Implement with plan
7. Review and revise

### Motivational Interviewing (MI)

**OARS Skills:**
- **Open questions**: Encourage exploration
- **Affirmations**: Recognize strengths
- **Reflections**: Mirror back what you hear
- **Summaries**: Pull together key themes

**Change Talk**:
Notice and strengthen statements about desire, ability, reasons, need, and commitment to change.

**Ambivalence**:
Explore both sides (reasons to change AND reasons to stay the same) to resolve stuck places.

### Exposure Therapy Principles

**For Anxiety:**
- Approach rather than avoid what you fear
- Stay in the situation until anxiety decreases (habituation)
- Repeat exposures (extinction learning)
- Start with manageable challenges (hierarchy)

---

## Therapeutic Stance & Relationship

### Core Conditions (Carl Rogers)

1. **Unconditional Positive Regard**: Non-judgmental acceptance
2. **Empathy**: Understanding from the other's perspective
3. **Congruence**: Authenticity and genuineness

### When to Seek Professional Help

- Persistent suicidal thoughts
- Self-harm urges or behaviors
- Severe anxiety/depression interfering with functioning
- Trauma symptoms (flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance)
- Relationship violence
- Substance use causing problems
- Significant eating disorder behaviors
- When self-help isn't enough

## People-Pleasing & The Fawn Response

### Understanding People-Pleasing as Trauma Response

**The Fawn Response** (coined by Pete Walker in *Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving*):

The fourth trauma response beyond fight, flight, and freeze. Fawning involves hyper-attuning to others' needs to ensure safety—becoming pleasing, helpful, or agreeable to avoid harm.

**Key Insight**: What's often labeled as "codependency" or a personality flaw is frequently a trauma-rooted nervous system adaptation. The fawn response develops when:
- Fight or flight aren't safe options (especially in childhood)
- Appeasement becomes the safest survival strategy
- The nervous system learns that pleasing others = safety

### Origins and Development

**Childhood Roots:**
- Children can't escape abusive or neglectful households
- They must make dangerous environments tolerable
- Attaching to caregivers is biologically necessary, even when caregivers are the source of harm
- Fawning bridges the conflict between needing to flee AND needing to attach

**What Gets Suppressed:**
- Authentic emotions (sadness, fear, anger)
- Personal needs and preferences
- Boundaries and limits
- The word "no"

**Long-Term Effects:**
- Confusion between fawning and identity ("This is just who I am")
- Difficulty knowing own preferences, needs, or feelings
- Chronic self-abandonment
- Exhaustion from constant attunement to others
- Resentment that builds from unmet needs
- Attracting/tolerating exploitative relationships

### Clinical Markers

**Behaviors to Notice:**
- Excessive apologizing
- Difficulty saying no
- Putting others' needs before your own consistently
- Changing opinions to match whoever you're with
- Fear of conflict or disappointing others
- Over-explaining or justifying decisions
- Reassurance-seeking
- Difficulty identifying own emotions or preferences
- Feeling responsible for others' emotions
- Staying in relationships/situations that don't serve you

**Thought Patterns:**
- "If I say no, they'll leave/be angry/reject me"
- "Their needs are more important than mine"
- "I should be able to handle this without complaining"
- "It's selfish to prioritize myself"
- "If I'm good enough, they'll love me"
- "Conflict is dangerous"

### The Nervous System Perspective

**Polyvagal Understanding (Stephen Porges):**

Fawning is a **dorsal vagal** response combined with **social engagement**—a hybrid state where:
- The body is in freeze/shutdown mode
- But social behaviors (smiling, agreeing, helping) remain active
- This creates the "please and appease" pattern

**Why It Feels Automatic:**
- Fawning bypasses conscious choice
- It's a nervous system strategy, not a personality trait
- The body learned: "Appeasing = survival"
- Unlearning requires nervous system rewiring, not just cognitive insight

### Therapeutic Approaches

#### 1. Trauma-Focused Work

Since people-pleasing often stems from developmental trauma, addressing root causes:

- **EMDR**: Processing early experiences where fawning developed
- **Somatic Therapies**: Working with body-held trauma
- **IFS (Parts Work)**: Understanding the protective function of the fawning part
- **CPTSD Treatment**: Addressing complex trauma patterns

#### 2. CBT for People-Pleasing

**Common Cognitive Distortions:**

| Distortion | Example | Challenge |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| Mind-reading | "They'll think I'm selfish" | Do I actually know what they think? |
| Catastrophizing | "If I say no, they'll leave forever" | What's the realistic outcome? |
| Should statements | "I should always be available" | Says who? Is this serving me? |
| Emotional reasoning | "I feel guilty, so I must be wrong" | Guilt doesn't mean I did something wrong |
| All-or-nothing | "Either I help or I'm a bad person" | Are there options between these extremes? |

**Behavioral Experiments:**
- Say no to a small request; observe what actually happens
- State a preference when asked "what do you want?"; notice the outcome
- Let someone be disappointed without fixing it; see if the relationship survives

#### 3. DBT Skills for People-Pleasing

**Interpersonal Effectiveness Module:**

**DEAR MAN** (Assertive Requests):
- **D**escribe: State the facts objectively ("When I work late every day...")
- **E**xpress: Use "I" statements ("I feel exhausted and overwhelmed")
- **A**ssert: State your need clearly ("I need to leave on time at least three days a week")
- **R**einforce: Explain benefits ("This will help me be more productive when I'm here")
- **M**indful: Stay focused; use "broken record" if needed
- **A**ppear confident: Voice, posture, eye contact
- **N**egotiate: Be willing to find middle ground

**FAST** (Self-Respect):
- **F**air: Be fair to yourself AND others (not just others)
- **A**pologies: No excessive apologizing for having needs
- **S**tick to values: Don't abandon your principles to please
- **T**ruthful: Be honest about what you want/need

**Practical Scripts:**

*Setting a boundary:*
"I care about you and I'm not available to do that right now."

*Declining a request:*
"Thank you for thinking of me. I'm going to pass on this one."

*Stating a preference:*
"I'd prefer [X]. What do you think?"

*Buying time:*
"Let me think about it and get back to you."

#### 4. ACT for People-Pleasing

**Workability Check:**
- Is people-pleasing moving you toward your values?
- What is it costing you? (Energy, authenticity, self-respect, resentment)
- What would values-aligned boundary-setting look like?

**Defusion from People-Pleasing Thoughts:**
- "I'm having the thought that they'll reject me if I say no"
- "My mind is telling me I'm selfish, and I can still set this boundary"
- "Thank you, mind, for trying to protect me from rejection"

**Values Clarification:**
- What matters to me beyond others' approval?
- Who do I want to be in relationships—a pleaser or an authentic person?
- What would self-respect look like in this situation?

#### 5. CFT/Self-Compassion for People-Pleasing

**Understanding the Inner Pleaser:**
- This part developed to protect you
- It learned that your safety depended on others' happiness
- It's trying to prevent abandonment and rejection
- Harsh self-judgment won't help it relax

**Compassionate Reframe:**
- From: "I'm so weak for always saying yes"
- To: "Part of me learned that saying yes kept me safe. That made sense then. I'm learning it's safe to have boundaries now."

**Self-Compassion Practice:**
"This is hard. Setting boundaries feels scary because my system learned that other people's needs had to come first. Many people struggle with this. I'm allowed to matter too."

#### 6. IFS for People-Pleasing

**Identifying the Parts:**

**The Pleaser (Manager):**
- Proactively manages relationships by anticipating needs
- Believes: "If I'm good enough, I'll be safe/loved"
- Positive intent: Protection from rejection/abandonment

**The Accommodator (Manager):**
- Says yes even when it's costly
- Believes: "Conflict is dangerous"
- Positive intent: Keeping the peace, maintaining connection

**The Exile (Underneath):**
- Carries the original wound (not being valued as-is)
- Holds fear of abandonment, rejection, not being enough
- The Pleaser protects this part from being triggered

**Dialogue with the Pleaser:**
"I see you working so hard to keep everyone happy. What are you afraid will happen if I say no?"
*Listen for the fear underneath—usually abandonment, rejection, or not being lovable.*
"Thank you for trying to protect me. What would you need to believe to relax a little?"

### Recovery Steps

**1. Increase Self-Awareness:**
- Notice when you're about to abandon your needs
- Track body sensations (tension, holding breath) when you want to say no but say yes
- Identify your values beyond others' approval

**2. Validate Your Own Needs:**
- Practice: "My needs matter as much as others'"
- Notice when you dismiss your preferences as unimportant
- Ask yourself: "What do I actually want here?"

**3. Build Distress Tolerance:**
- People-pleasers often say yes to avoid discomfort of conflict
- Practice tolerating others' disappointment
- Remind yourself: Their disappointment is theirs to manage

**4. Start Small:**
- Practice boundaries in low-stakes situations first
- Say no to something minor; observe what happens
- Build evidence that boundaries don't destroy relationships

**5. Develop Self-Compassion:**
- The fawn response developed for good reason
- Healing isn't about becoming "tough"—it's about becoming boundaried AND connected
- Progress is nonlinear; old patterns will resurface under stress

### Boundary-Setting Framework

**Before Setting a Boundary:**
1. Identify what you need/want
2. Check: Is this aligned with my values?
3. Prepare for discomfort (yours and theirs)
4. Remember: You're responsible for your boundary, not their reaction

**The Boundary Formula:**
"I [feel/need] _____ and I'm [going to/not going to] _____."

*Examples:*
- "I need rest tonight and I'm going to stay home."
- "I feel overwhelmed and I'm not going to take on extra projects this week."
- "I care about you and I'm not available to discuss this right now."

**After Setting a Boundary:**
- Tolerate discomfort without backtracking
- Don't over-explain or justify
- Notice: Did the relationship survive?
- Celebrate the courage it took

### When Fawning Shows Up in Relationships

**Signs You're Fawning:**
- Agreeing with opinions you don't hold
- Saying you're "fine" when you're not
- Taking responsibility for their emotions
- Abandoning plans/preferences for theirs
- Feeling like you're performing rather than being yourself
- Resentment building underneath accommodation

**In Romantic Relationships:**
- Over-functioning (doing more than your share)
- Difficulty expressing needs or preferences
- Tolerating treatment that doesn't feel good
- Losing yourself in the relationship
- Fear that being authentic will end the relationship

**Recovery in Relationships:**
- Practice stating preferences ("I'd like to...")
- Let them experience your authentic emotions
- Allow them to be disappointed sometimes
- Notice if the relationship can hold your realness
