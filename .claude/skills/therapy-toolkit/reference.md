## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

### The CBT Model

**Core Principle**: Thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected. Changing thoughts changes feelings and behaviors.

```
Situation → Thoughts → Feelings → Behaviors
              ↑__________________________|
```

### Common Cognitive Distortions

**Aaron Beck & David Burns' Classic Distortions:**

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black-and-White)**
   - Seeing things in absolutes: always, never, perfect, disaster
   - Example: "If I don't get this job, I'm a complete failure"

2. **Overgeneralization**
   - Single event becomes a pattern
   - Example: "I got rejected once, so I'll always be rejected"

3. **Mental Filter**
   - Focusing exclusively on negatives while filtering out positives
   - Example: Receiving 9 compliments and 1 criticism, only remembering the criticism

4. **Disqualifying the Positive**
   - Dismissing positive experiences as "they don't count"
   - Example: "They're just being nice, they don't mean it"

5. **Jumping to Conclusions**
   - **Mind Reading**: Assuming you know what others think
   - **Fortune Telling**: Predicting negative outcomes
   - Example: "They haven't texted back, they must hate me"

6. **Magnification/Minimization (Catastrophizing)**
   - Exaggerating problems, minimizing positives
   - Example: "This small mistake will ruin everything"

7. **Emotional Reasoning**
   - Believing feelings reflect reality
   - Example: "I feel like a fraud, therefore I am a fraud"

8. **Should Statements**
   - Rigid rules about how you/others "should" be
   - Example: "I should always be productive" or "They should know better"

9. **Labeling**
   - Global labels instead of specific behaviors
   - Example: "I'm lazy" vs. "I didn't feel motivated today"

10. **Personalization/Blame**
    - Taking responsibility for things outside your control OR blaming others entirely
    - Example: "It's all my fault" or "It's all their fault"

### Cognitive Restructuring Process

**The 7-Column Thought Record:**

1. **Situation**: What happened? (objective facts)
2. **Automatic Thought**: What went through your mind?
3. **Emotion**: What did you feel? (intensity 0-100)
4. **Evidence For**: What supports this thought?
5. **Evidence Against**: What contradicts this thought?
6. **Alternative Thought**: More balanced perspective
7. **New Emotion**: How do you feel now? (intensity 0-100)

### Core Beliefs

**Three Levels of Cognition:**

1. **Automatic Thoughts**: Surface-level, spontaneous thoughts
2. **Intermediate Beliefs**: Rules, attitudes, assumptions ("If...then" statements)
3. **Core Beliefs**: Deep beliefs about self, others, world

**Common Core Belief Themes:**
- **Helplessness**: "I'm powerless," "I'm inadequate," "I'm a failure"
- **Unlovability**: "I'm unworthy," "I'm defective," "I'll be abandoned"
- **Worthlessness**: "I'm bad," "I don't matter," "I'm insignificant"

### Socratic Questioning

Therapeutic questions to examine thoughts:

- What's the evidence for and against this thought?
- What would you tell a friend who had this thought?
- What's the worst that could happen? How would you cope?
- What's the best that could happen? What's most realistic?
- What's the effect of believing this thought?
- What would be a more helpful way to think about this?

## Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

### Core Dialectic

**Balance opposites**: Acceptance AND Change

**Opposite Action**
- When emotion doesn't fit facts or isn't effective, act opposite
- Fear → Approach what you fear
- Sadness/Depression → Get active, connect

## Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

### The Six Core Processes (Hexaflex)

#### 1. Cognitive Defusion

**Principle**: Thoughts are just thoughts, not facts or commands.

**Techniques:**
- "I'm having the thought that..."
- Thank your mind: "Thanks, mind, for that thought"
- Sing the thought to a silly tune
- Say the word repeatedly until it loses meaning
- Imagine thoughts as leaves floating down a stream

#### 2. Acceptance

**Principle**: Make room for painful feelings and sensations rather than struggling against them.

**Practices:**
- Notice resistance and soften
- Breathe into discomfort
- Expand awareness around difficult feelings
- "What if I didn't have to fix this feeling?"

#### 3. Present Moment

**Principle**: Conscious awareness of the here and now.

**Practices:**
- Five senses grounding
- Notice what's here right now
- Return attention to the present when mind wanders
- Engage fully in current activity

#### 4. Self as Context

**Principle**: You are not your thoughts, feelings, or experiences—you're the awareness experiencing them.

**Perspective:**
- Observer self vs. thinking self
- "I notice I'm having anxiety" vs. "I am anxious"
- The sky (you) vs. the weather (your experiences)

#### 5. Values

**Principle**: Chosen life directions that guide meaningful action.

**Values vs. Goals:**
- Values are directions (ongoing): "Being a loving partner"
- Goals are destinations (achievable): "Getting married"

**Core Life Domains:**
- Relationships (family, friends, intimate)
- Work/Education/Growth
- Recreation/Leisure
- Health/Well-being
- Spirituality/Contribution

**Values Clarification Questions:**
- What do you want your life to stand for?
- What do you want to be remembered for?
- If no one would know, what would you do?

#### 6. Committed Action

**Principle**: Take values-based action even in the presence of discomfort.

**Implementation:**
- Break values into specific behaviors
- SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- Start small (tiny habits)
- Notice barriers (fusion, avoidance)

### Psychological Flexibility

The meta-goal of ACT: Being present, open, and engaged in what matters.

**Inflexibility → Flexibility:**
- Fusion → Defusion
- Avoidance → Acceptance
- Past/Future focus → Present moment
- Attachment to conceptualized self → Self as context
- Lack of clarity → Values clarity
- Inaction/Impulsivity → Committed action

## Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT)

### Three Affect Regulation Systems

1. **Threat System** (Red): Protection, safety-seeking
   - Anxiety, anger, disgust
   - Fight/flight/freeze

2. **Drive System** (Orange): Achievement, resource-seeking
   - Excitement, motivation, pursuit
   - Dopamine-driven

3. **Soothing System** (Green): Contentment, affiliation
   - Calm, safe, connected
   - Oxytocin-based

**Modern Problem**: Overactive threat/drive systems, underactive soothing system.

### Self-Compassion (Kristin Neff)

**Three Components:**

1. **Self-Kindness** vs. Self-Judgment
   - Treating yourself with warmth and understanding
   - Being gentle rather than harsh

2. **Common Humanity** vs. Isolation
   - Recognizing suffering is part of shared human experience
   - "I'm not alone in this"

3. **Mindfulness** vs. Over-Identification
   - Balanced awareness of painful thoughts/feelings
   - Neither suppressing nor ruminating

### Compassionate Mind Practice

**Compassionate Self Attributes:**
- Caring for well-being
- Sensitivity to suffering
- Sympathy and concern
- Distress tolerance
- Empathy and understanding
- Non-judgment

**What Would You Say to a Friend?**
- Notice the difference between how you talk to yourself vs. how you'd talk to someone you care about
- Extend that same kindness to yourself

### Functions of Self-Criticism

**Understanding the Inner Critic:**
- Often trying to protect you (from failure, rejection, shame)
- Learned strategy, usually from childhood
- Harsh doesn't mean effective

**Reframing:**
- From: "I'm so stupid for making that mistake"
- To: "Part of me is scared I'll fail, and it's trying to protect me by being harsh. But there's a kinder way to motivate myself."

## Internal Family Systems (IFS)

### Core Concepts

**Parts**: Sub-personalities or mental/emotional states within you.

**Self**: Core essence characterized by curiosity, compassion, calm, confidence, courage, clarity, creativity, connectedness (the 8 C's).

### Types of Parts

1. **Exiles**: Vulnerable parts carrying pain, shame, trauma
   - Often young parts holding difficult emotions
   - Other parts try to keep them hidden

2. **Managers**: Proactive protectors
   - Try to keep you in control and safe
   - Examples: Perfectionist, Critic, Planner, Caretaker

3. **Firefighters**: Reactive protectors
   - Activated when exiles break through
   - Distraction, numbing, impulsive behaviors
   - Examples: Binge eating, substance use, dissociation

### IFS Process

1. **Notice** a part (voice, feeling, sensation)
2. **Get curious** about it (not pushing it away)
3. **Ask** what it wants you to know
4. **Understand** its positive intent
5. **Appreciate** it for trying to help
6. **Negotiate** with it from Self

**Sample Dialogue:**
- "I notice a part of me that's really anxious about this decision."
- "What are you afraid will happen if I make the wrong choice?"
- "You're trying to protect me from failure. I appreciate that."
- "What if we worked together? What would you need from me to relax a bit?"

3. Schedule specific activities
4. Start small and build
5. Notice mood shifts (action precedes motivation)

### Problem-Solving Therapy (PST)

**7 Steps:**
1. Identify the problem (specific, concrete)
2. Set realistic goals
3. Brainstorm solutions (no evaluation yet)
4. Evaluate options (pros/cons)

### Exposure Therapy Principles

**For Anxiety:**
- Approach rather than avoid what you fear
- Stay in the situation until anxiety decreases (habituation)
- Repeat exposures (extinction learning)
- Start with manageable challenges (hierarchy)
