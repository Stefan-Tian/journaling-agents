description: Apply CBT, DBT, ACT, and other therapeutic techniques to journal entries for insight and growth
---

## Overview

**Important**: This skill references [../context.md](../context.md) for Stefan's personal context. See [reference.md](reference.md) for details.

This skill applies evidence-based therapeutic techniques to help you:

1. **Identify cognitive distortions** and unhelpful thought patterns
2. **Regulate difficult emotions** using DBT skills
3. **Clarify values** and take committed action (ACT)
4. **Develop self-compassion** and reduce self-criticism (CFT)
5. **Address people-pleasing** and the fawn trauma response

## Core Modalities

| Modality | Focus | When Most Useful |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **CBT** | Thought patterns | Stuck in negative thinking, rumination |
| **DBT** | Emotion regulation | Overwhelm, distress, interpersonal conflict |
| **ACT** | Values & action | Avoidance, disconnection from purpose |
| **CFT** | Self-compassion | Self-criticism, shame, perfectionism |
| **Fawn/People-Pleasing** | Boundaries & self-advocacy | Over-accommodating, difficulty saying no, self-abandonment |

## Entry Selection

When analyzing a journal entry:
1. **First**, look for `entry-polished.md` in the entry folder
2. **Only if polished doesn't exist**, fall back to `entry.md`

This ensures analysis is performed on the highest-quality version of the writing.

## When to Use

- Stuck in negative thinking patterns or rumination
- Experiencing emotional overwhelm or distress
- Struggling with self-criticism or shame
- Avoiding important actions or decisions
- Feeling disconnected from values and purpose
- **People-pleasing patterns**: Difficulty saying no, abandoning your needs for others, chronic over-accommodation

## What This Skill Does

**Adaptive Analysis**: Rather than running ALL frameworks, this skill identifies the 1-2 most relevant modalities based on what's present in your entry and focuses there.

### CBT: Cognitive Restructuring
- Identify automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions
- Examine evidence for and against
- Generate balanced alternatives

### DBT: Emotion Regulation
- Validate emotions (both/and)
- Recommend specific skills (TIPP, Opposite Action, PLEASE, etc.)
- Build distress tolerance

### ACT: Values & Flexibility
- Clarify values at stake
- Check workability of current approach
- Practice defusion from unhelpful thoughts
- Identify committed action

### CFT: Self-Compassion
- Notice self-critical voice
- Reframe with compassion
- Understand protective function of criticism

### Fawn Response / People-Pleasing
- Identify people-pleasing as trauma response (not personality flaw)
- Apply DEAR MAN and FAST skills for assertiveness
- Build distress tolerance for others' disappointment
- Practice boundary-setting with self-compassion

## Guiding Principles

1. **Less is more**: Focus on what's most relevant, not everything
2. **Validation first**: Acknowledge before challenging
3. **Actionable**: End with doable next steps
4. **Non-pathologizing**: Normal human struggles, not diagnoses

## Tone

- Warm, concise, non-judgmental
- Balance validation with gentle challenge
- Empower rather than prescribe
