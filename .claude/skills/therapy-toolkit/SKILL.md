## Overview

**Important**: This skill references [../context.md](../context.md) for Stefan's personal context. See [reference.md](reference.md) for details.

This skill applies evidence-based therapeutic techniques to help you:

1. **Identify cognitive distortions** and unhelpful thought patterns
2. **Regulate difficult emotions** using DBT skills
3. **Clarify values** and take committed action (ACT)
4. **Develop self-compassion** and reduce self-criticism (CFT)

## Core Modalities

| Modality | Focus | When Most Useful |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| **CBT** | Thought patterns | Stuck in negative thinking, rumination |
| **DBT** | Emotion regulation | Overwhelm, distress, interpersonal conflict |
| **ACT** | Values & action | Avoidance, disconnection from purpose |
| **CFT** | Self-compassion | Self-criticism, shame, perfectionism |

## When to Use

- Stuck in negative thinking patterns or rumination
- Experiencing emotional overwhelm or distress
- Struggling with self-criticism or shame
- Avoiding important actions or decisions
- Feeling disconnected from values and purpose

## What This Skill Does

### CBT: Cognitive Restructuring

### ACT: Values & Flexibility

- Check workability of current approach
- Practice defusion from unhelpful thoughts
- Identify committed action

### CFT: Self-Compassion

2. **Validation first**: Acknowledge before challenging
3. **Actionable**: End with doable next steps
4. **Non-pathologizing**: Normal human struggles, not diagnoses

## Tone

- Warm, concise, non-judgmental
- Balance validation with gentle challenge
- Empower rather than prescribe
