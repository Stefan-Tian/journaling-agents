# Depth Psychology - Reference Guide

## Carl Jung - Complete Framework

### The Structure of the Psyche

**Consciousness (Ego)**
The center of awareness. What you call "I." It:
- Selects what enters awareness
- Maintains personal identity
- Relates to the external world
- Can be too narrow (missing important information)

**Personal Unconscious**
Contains:
- Forgotten experiences
- Repressed memories
- Subliminal perceptions
- Things not yet conscious
Similar to Freud's unconscious but includes more than repression

**Collective Unconscious**
Jung's revolutionary contribution:
- Inherited, universal layer of psyche
- Shared by all humanity
- Contains archetypes - innate patterns
- Source of myths, religions, symbols across cultures
- Not personally acquired

### The Four Major Archetypes

**1. The Persona**
*Latin for "mask" (actor's mask)*

The social face we present:
- Adapts to social expectations
- Protects the inner self
- Necessary for functioning
- Becomes problematic when we over-identify with it

**Signs of Persona Inflation**:
- Can't relax the mask
- Feel like a fraud
- Don't know who you "really" are
- Exhausted from performing
- Different selves in different contexts feel fragmented

**Healthy Persona**:
- Flexible, can be put on and taken off
- Appropriate to context
- Doesn't override authentic self
- Serves rather than controls

**2. The Shadow**
*"Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is."*

The shadow contains:
- Rejected qualities (weakness, anger, sexuality, etc.)
- Undeveloped potentials
- Both personal and collective material
- "Golden shadow" - positive qualities we also reject

**How Shadow Appears**:
- Strong emotional reactions to others
- Projections onto enemies or villains
- What you criticize most in others
- Slips, dreams, symptoms
- What you'd be mortified if others knew

**Shadow Work Process**:
1. Notice strong reactions (what triggers you?)
2. Own the projection (this quality is in ME)
3. Explore the origin (when did I reject this?)
4. Find the value (what does this part offer?)
5. Integrate consciously (express appropriately)

**3. Anima / Animus**
*The contrasexual element in the psyche*

**Anima** (in men):
- The inner feminine
- Mediates to the unconscious
- Carries feeling, relatedness, receptivity
- Often first projected onto women
- Development: Eve (sexual) → Helen (romantic) → Mary (spiritual) → Sophia (wisdom)

**Animus** (in men's psychology context - may apply differently in LGBTQ+ contexts):
- The inner masculine
- Carries assertion, logos, discrimination
- Development: Physical power → Romantic ideal → Word/meaning → Spiritual meaning

**Signs of Anima/Animus Possession**:
- Mood swings, irrational emotions
- Opinionated rigidity
- Excessive identification with partner
- Projection of idealization or demonization

**Note on LGBTQ+ Contexts**:
Jung's binary gender model was of his time. For gay men, the anima may manifest differently - perhaps in relationship to femininity, receptivity, or the creative soul. The core principle remains: integrating complementary qualities.

**4. The Self**
*"The archetype of archetypes"*

The Self represents:
- The totality of the psyche
- Center AND circumference
- The organizing principle
- The goal of individuation
- Often symbolized by mandalas, circles, quaternities

**Self vs. Ego**:
- Ego is the center of consciousness
- Self is the center of the entire psyche (conscious + unconscious)
- Individuation = ego developing relationship with Self

**Experiences of the Self**:
- Moments of profound meaning
- Numinous or mystical experiences
- Feeling of wholeness
- Synchronicities
- Peak experiences
- Sense of being "on the right path"

---

### Individuation

**Definition**: The process of becoming who you truly are - integrating conscious and unconscious into a whole person.

**First Half of Life** (roughly before 35-40):
- Build ego strength
- Develop persona
- Achieve outer world success
- Establish identity, career, relationships
- Differentiation from family of origin

**Midlife Transition**:
- What worked stops working
- Questions of meaning arise
- Shadow material breaks through
- Invitation to inner work
- Crisis as opportunity

**Second Half of Life**:
- Integration of opposites
- Relationship with the Self
- Meaning over achievement
- Service to something larger
- Preparation for death

**Signs of Individuation Progress**:
- Less projection onto others
- Increased self-acceptance
- Holding paradox and complexity
- Connection to meaning and purpose
- Greater authenticity
- Integration of formerly rejected parts

### Psychological Types

**The Four Functions**:

| Function | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Thinking** | Rational | Logical analysis, true/false |
| **Feeling** | Rational | Value assessment, good/bad |
| **Sensation** | Irrational | Concrete perception, what IS |
| **Intuition** | Irrational | Possibilities, what COULD BE |

**The Two Attitudes**:
- **Extraversion**: Energy flows outward to objects
- **Introversion**: Energy flows inward to subject

**The Inferior Function**:
The least developed function - source of:
- Vulnerability and sensitivity
- Gateway to the unconscious
- Where we feel incompetent
- Often activated under stress

**Development**:
- Natural development strengthens dominant function
- Individuation requires developing inferior function
- Don't try to make inferior dominant - develop relationship with it

---

### Complex Theory

**Definition**: Autonomous clusters of emotions, memories, and thoughts around a core theme.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Operate independently of ego control
- Have their own "willpower"
- Activated by triggers
- Create mood states and behaviors
- Originally formed through emotional experiences

**Common Complexes**:
- Mother complex
- Father complex
- Power complex
- Inferiority complex
- Hero complex
- Savior complex

**Working with Complexes**:
1. **Name it**: "My mother complex is active"
2. **Observe**: Notice when triggered, what happens
3. **Don't act from it**: Create space between trigger and response
4. **Understand its origins**: Trace back to formative experiences
5. **Integrate**: Develop conscious relationship

**Complex vs. Archetype**:
- Complex = personal, formed in your life
- Archetype = universal, inherited pattern
- Complexes cluster around archetypal cores

### Dreams in Jungian Psychology

**Basic Principles**:

1. **Dreams are natural, meaningful**: Not disguised or deceptive
2. **Dreams compensate**: Balance the conscious attitude
3. **All figures are parts of you**: The unconscious uses external images to represent internal dynamics
4. **Context matters**: Same symbol means different things to different people

**Types of Dreams**:
- **Compensatory**: Most common; balance conscious one-sidedness
- **Prospective**: Point toward future development
- **Traumatic/Repetitive**: Process unintegrated material
- **Archetypal/Big Dreams**: Numinous, memorable, collective significance

**Robert Johnson's Four-Step Method**:

**Step 1: Associations**
For each dream element, ask:
- What does this remind me of?
- What feelings does it evoke?
- What memories connect to it?
- What does this mean TO ME?

**Step 2: Connect to Inner Dynamics**
Ask:
- What part of me does this represent?
- What inner situation does this reflect?
- Remember: the dream is ALWAYS about you, even when it features others

**Step 3: Interpret**
Ask:
- What is the unconscious trying to say?
- What does my conscious life lack that this dream supplies?
- What is being compensated?

**Step 4: Ritual**
Honor the dream through action:
- Write it down
- Make art
- Talk about it
- Light a candle
- Physical gesture
- The unconscious needs to know it was heard

**Common Dream Motifs**:
| Motif | Possible Meaning |
|-------|------------------|
| Being chased | Avoiding shadow material |
| Flying | Inflation, spiritual freedom |
| Falling | Coming down to earth, loss of control |
| Teeth falling out | Anxiety, loss of power, transition |
| Being naked | Vulnerability, exposure |
| Houses | The self, different rooms = different aspects |
| Water | Unconscious, emotions |
| Vehicles | How you move through life |
| Death | Transformation, ending of phase |

### Active Imagination

**Definition**: Conscious engagement with unconscious contents through imagery, dialogue, or creative expression.

**Purpose**:
- Bridge conscious and unconscious
- Dialogue with inner figures
- Process dream material
- Access deeper wisdom

**Method**:
1. **Quiet the mind**: Relax, let go of active thinking
2. **Focus on an image**: Dream fragment, mood, body sensation
3. **Let it develop**: Watch, don't control
4. **Engage**: Enter the scene, dialogue with figures
5. **Record**: Write, draw, paint, move
6. **Integrate**: What does this mean for waking life?

**Guidelines**:
- Approach with humility, not conquest
- Let figures be themselves, not what you want
- Stay grounded - maintain ego consciousness
- Honor what emerges
- Don't share publicly (keeps it numinous)

**Caution**:
- Not for those actively psychotic
- Maintain ego stability
- Ground yourself after
- Work with therapist if intense material arises

---

### Synchronicity

**Definition**: Meaningful coincidence - events connected by meaning, not cause.

**Examples**:
- Thinking of someone, they call
- Reading about a topic, encountering it everywhere
- Dreams that "come true"
- Symbolic timing of events

**Significance**:
- Points to the interconnection of psyche and world
- Often occurs during times of transition
- Signals you're on a meaningful path
- Bridges inner and outer

**How to Work with Synchronicity**:
1. Notice it (requires attention)
2. Ask: What meaning does this have?
3. Record and track patterns
4. Don't force interpretation
5. Let meaning emerge
