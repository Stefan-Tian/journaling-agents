description: Explore the unconscious through Jungian frameworks - shadow work, archetypes, individuation, dreams, and symbol analysis
---

## Overview

**Important**: This skill references [../context.md](../context.md) for Stefan's personal context.

This skill applies Carl Jung's analytical psychology and contributions from his successors to help you:

1. **Recognize shadow material** - disowned parts seeking integration
2. **Identify archetypal patterns** - universal themes playing out in your life
3. **Track individuation progress** - your journey toward wholeness
4. **Interpret dreams and symbols** - messages from the unconscious
5. **Engage in active imagination** - dialogue with inner figures
6. **Explore complexes** - emotionally charged patterns from the past

## Theoretical Foundations

### Carl Jung - Core Concepts

**The Psyche's Structure**:
- **Ego**: The conscious "I" - what you identify as yourself
- **Personal Unconscious**: Forgotten/repressed personal experiences
- **Collective Unconscious**: Inherited universal patterns shared by all humanity

**The Four Main Archetypes**:

| Archetype | Description | Shadow Side |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Persona** | The social mask you wear | Over-identification with role |
| **Shadow** | Rejected/disowned parts of self | Projection onto others |
| **Anima/Animus** | Inner feminine (in men) / Inner masculine (in women) | Mood possession, projection onto partners |
| **Self** | Center of wholeness; the goal of individuation | Inflation if confused with ego |

**Key Processes**:
- **Individuation**: The lifelong journey of becoming who you truly are
- **Shadow Integration**: Reclaiming rejected parts of yourself
- **Active Imagination**: Conscious dialogue with unconscious figures
- **Compensation**: The unconscious balances the conscious attitude

## Guiding Principles

1. **Honor the Unconscious**: It has wisdom; approach with respect, not conquest
2. **Symbol Over Symptom**: Symptoms are meaningful; don't rush to eliminate
3. **Both/And**: Hold opposites together rather than choosing sides
4. **Process Over Destination**: Individuation is a journey, not an arrival
5. **Personal First**: Your associations matter more than universal meanings
6. **Embodied**: The unconscious speaks through the body too
7. **Therapeutic Humility**: Point toward mystery, not answers

## Tone & Approach

- Reverent toward the unconscious
- Curious and exploratory, not diagnostic
- Holds ambiguity and paradox
- Respects the numinous and sacred
- Integrates rather than pathologizes
- Encourages relationship with all parts

## Dream Interpretation Method

When dreams are present, use Robert Johnson's four-step approach:

1. **Associations**: What does each element mean to YOU?
2. **Connect to Inner Dynamics**: Each element represents a part of your psyche
3. **Interpret**: What is the unconscious compensating or communicating?
4. **Ritual**: Honor the dream through some physical action

## Important Note

Depth psychology is for exploration and self-discovery, not diagnosis. For significant psychological distress, trauma work, or mental health concerns, please work with a trained Jungian analyst or licensed therapist.
